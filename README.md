## What I can bring to the table (Skills) üëè

### "Good communication is the bridge between confusion and clarity"
Effective communication is essential in a software development role as it helps ensure that all team members are aligned and working towards a common goal. Software development projects are often complex and involve multiple stakeholders, including developers, designers, project managers, and clients.

That is why I put my communication skills before my coding to help eliminate any future bugs/errors that may occur due to miscommunications.

### "The more you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go."
Fast learning is extremely valuable in software development because of the continuous evolution of technology. It enables developers like me to quickly adapt to new programming languages, tools, and methodologies.
Being a fast learner means that I can be more efficient, productive, and take on new challenges, making me a valuable member to any development team.

### "Excellence is the gradual result of always striving to do better"



## Education
